# JSON-Obfuscator
JSON Obfuscator is good way to make it harder for people to read your JSON file!
This is useful for those out there who make add-ons in Minecraft Bedrock Edition! This can make your json be written in Unicode form. Makes it hard for other people to just scan through the JSON and know what's really going on.

Feel free to look through the code.
I have left comments in the code itself explaining what each of the code does.

I have made this as compact as possible. Hope this helps you!
