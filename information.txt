[WARNING]

JSON Obfuscator is made to make it harder for humans to read the JSON!
That doesn't mean the unicode won't be fully readable. This still can be translated by another program-

-----------------------------
|How to use JSON Obfuscator?|
-----------------------------
* First of all, make sure you got node.js installed!
* Well, it's pretty straight forward from now on go to the file called 'json.txt' then paste your json. Make sure you JSON is valid!
* Once you pasted your JSON in 'json.txt' run the file called 'run.bat' OR go into the terminal and type 'node .'
* After that depending on your 'json.txt' file size it will take time to process and write your obfuscated JSON in 'obfuscated.json'

- If you want to make your JSON harder to read go to 'settings.json' make the '"Minifier?"' boolean value to true-

You are done!
